Matlab Package of Para_DPMM model for single cell transcriptomic clustering
introduced in paper "Parallelized Inference for Single Cell Transcriptomic Clustering
with Split Merge Sampling on DPMM Model", Author: Tiehang Duan; Xiaohui Xie;

The execution of this package is tested on HPC clusters with module gcc/6.1.0,
gsl/2.3 and MATLAB/r2017b loaded; 


Usage:

On HPC command line:

1. module load gcc/6.1.0

2. module load gsl/2.3

3. module load MATLAB/r2017b

4. ./Para_DPMM

then follow guidelines printed in the program (an example):

5. Please enter dataset path:  ./datasets/data_matrix_1_S_Set.mat

6. Please enter number of processors:  16

7. Please set the value of alpha:  1

8. Please enter computing time limit (seconds):  40

The training iteration and computation time log is saved in Para_DPMM_output.txt, 
the clustering result is saved in Para_DPMM_result.mat, where z is the clustering result
of Para_DPMM model, label is the ground truth cluster label, AR is Adjusted Random Index,
RI is Random Index benchmark, MI is "Mirkin's" index and HI is "Hubert's" index.


In the paper, we performed comparison with several current state of art single cell
clustering methods. Most of the methods are available in the form of R package,
and in the "interface to comparison methods" folders, we provide interface programs (written in R)
to use these datasets with the available R packages for comparison.

Please feel free to use it for academic purposes. For business deployment in genomic analysis, please contact the author.





Note: This package utilizes multiple functions from the open sourced Dirichlet Process Mixtures package(http://people.csail.mit.edu/jchang7/code.php) written by Jason Chang.
